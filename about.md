Hi! 

As you can guess by the hostname my name is Roberto Belardo and i am a Software Engineer with a lot of passions, one of which is IT. Here you can read some notes about me, what i did, what i am currently doing, and what i would like to do in the future.

## Past

**I was born in Rome in 1982** and i quickly found my way through life till the moment i got my first computer. A Commodore 64. I still remember the hours spent waiting those cassettes while loading… That was really a pain in the *** but it was worth it. From then on it was an escalation of love for “computer stuff“.

The decision to get a **Master Degree in Computer Science Engineering** was straightforward. I **graduated cum laude** at the University of Rome Tor Vergata with a thesis on “Web services selection and QoS monitoring“.

Once graduated i decided to **try living in London**, so i made my bags and i left for London looking for a job. But i didn’t have a great timing, because there was the entire Europe who was just graduated and looking for a job in London, so i just spent a month there, i have made some friends and i have exercised my English.

Once back from London i **started working at Engineering** on a product for Tim Brazil. I developed backend modules for that huge webapp, refactored a lot of legacy code and managed production deploy two times **on site with the client in Sao Paulo, Brazil**. It was an amazing experience that i will remember for the rest of my life. There i have meet true friends, i have spent nights programming, facing the client and eating picanha.

I wrote significant software in Java, C, Objective C, Ruby on Rails, Perl and Php.

I wrote Hello World in Python, C++, Javascript, etc…

## Present

I am **currently working in Rome for Rai – Radiotelevisione Italiana** where, along with a strong team, i am re-engineernig business processes from analog to digital. We are developing a variety of softwares to replace cassettes with files and switch to digital the entire production chain. In particular, handle the efficient transfer of very large files , i build last-minute prototypes, i revise supplier’s Java code in order to meet our quality standards.

My current interests includes nosql databases (i recently certified as **MongoDB developer**), Agile methodologies (i am certifying as a **Certified Scrum Master**)  and the development of iOS apps (I have designed and developed with two friends **QuitItApp**, and we have positioned finalists at SMAU 2012) .

In my free time i like to do rock climbing, snowboarding, make photos, go mountain biking with my friends and play with Ettore, my dog.

## Future

Looking to the next future **i am considering moving abroad** looking for new motivation. I would like to work in a European capital such as **Berlin or Amsterdam** (of which i fell in love during two trips i have done in recent years), perhaps **in a start-up**, where you can learn from new colleagues, where i could become attached to a product and where to apply agile methodologies that i have studied.
