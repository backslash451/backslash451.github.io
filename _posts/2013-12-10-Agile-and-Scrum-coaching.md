Yesterday I had the chance of **introducing Agile methodologies and the Scrum framework** to my colleagues. As I already said on this blog, I recently finished my **Certified Scrum Master** training and right after that I found some of my colleagues were interested in what I learned so they asked me for a very first introduction to Agile and Scrum. Most of them was pretty virgin to Agile, they never heard about it (!!). Our company is very traditional and old style and it is trying to renew itself from its roots but it will take a while. So I took the chance and prepared some slides, bought some markers and post-it and tried to spread the infection. This is how it went.

##Coaching

We were ten people and we made a session of 1 hour and a half, but the discussion continued for about another half hour (and it is still going). I presented the slides I prepared going through some key points.

* Why do we need to change?
* History: from Ford, Taylor, Fajol theories to “modern times”
* What’s wrong with us?
* Agile Manifesto
* Scrum
* Scrum roles
* Scrum framework
* Pros and “cons”
* (some) Extreme Programming practices
* (some) common Agile practices
* Now what?

This was a very very short introduction to Agile and Scrum. I used the slides as the main medium and a paperboard with markers and post-it to illustrate key concepts through quick sketches and typical Agile tools as the Taskboard or the Burn down chart. I followed the path Martin Alaimo used during our training but I had very less time so my sketches are really worst.

##Feedbacks

**The feedback from my colleagues was astonishing**. At the beginning they were just curious, maybe curious about that fool who spent his own money in a training on a topic our company will probably never ever consider. During the talk I started to see them nodding and at the end they were really excited. They asked questions, they tried to understand how something like this could work for their environments, and some of them said something like “*we are doing it totally wrong!*“.

A bit of fear came up during the discussion when someone tried to pick this or that element saying “*ok why don’t we start with a task board? It would be great! A lot of visibility! Bosses can no longer charge you with other things to do because they can see you have a lots of post-it on the task board!*“. So the fear came up and the answer was something like “*Never. They will probably use this against us in some manner!*“. Nothing new here. Us and them. Scrum-but.

But then the excitement has grown again and the team started asking for materials, links, books, resources etc… They asked “*where do we start?*“. I was really moved.

##Conclusions

Coaching my colleagues introducing them the concepts of Agile, Scrum and XP was a beautiful experience. Now they are somehow infected. One of them today seemed to be absent, staring into space. When I asked him what was going on, if everything was ok he answered me:

> “Yesterday you showed us Agile. Now I am here.”

He was referring to our dear old fashioned traditional company, with its waterfall approach to projects, its priorities model based on who shouts the loudest, its “everything should be designed up-front in every detail and be ready for yesterday“.

We started as a group of masons who meet secretly early in the morning but now the infection is spreading. Other colleagues have heard of the coaching session and they want to join.

It would be wonderful to approach this Top-down, with active management involvement, but as usual **we have to start Bottom-up**. We are selecting some practices to start. **We need to keep the infection going**.
