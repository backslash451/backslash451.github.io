This is just a short post to present my last project, Climba-data.

##What is Climba-data
Climba-data is a community driven open source free json database of italian climbing spots with infos on sectors and routes.

##Why Climba-data
Italy is a country where rock climbing is spreading like wildfire. So many great places where you can climb and a great community of passionate people growing day by day with veterans helping newbie climbing higher and higher. But until now climbers have had to rely on word of mouth, printed guides or old style incomplete websites.

A lucky climber could have found a website with a great list of climbing spots, but other than contributing to that list, suggesting corrections or improvements he can do nothing more. For example he cannot download the list, he cannot develop an idea on that list. And that's because that list is private. Someone built a business on that and he doesn't want you to use it for your ideas.

This is where Climba-data comes in. We want you to use the list, to improve it, to share it and to build whatever you want out of it.

##Climba
We used Climba-data to built [Climba](http://climba.parseapp.com), an iOS app for climbers. As of now the app is still under revision by Apple but it should be released to public very soon.
