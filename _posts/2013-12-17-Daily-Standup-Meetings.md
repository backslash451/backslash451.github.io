##Intro
After the first introduction of Agile and Scrum I made in my company and after the enthusiastic feedbacks I got from the team we decided to introduce the daily standup meetings (aka Daily Scrum meetings) in our process. Here is a short  post on how it is going.

##What
The Development Team is self-organizing. The Development Team uses the Daily Scrum meeting to ensure that they are on track for attaining the Sprint Goal. The meeting takes place at the same time and place every day. Each Development Team member gives three bits of information:

* What I have accomplished since our last Daily Scrum;
* What I plan to accomplish between now and our next Daily Scrum;
* What is impeding my progress.

There may be brief clarifying questions and answers, but there is no discussion of any of these topics during the Daily Scrum. However, many teams meet right after the Daily Scrum to work on any issues that have come up. 

The Daily Scrum is not a report to management, nor to the Product Owner, nor to the ScrumMaster. **It is a communication meeting within the Development Team, to ensure that they are all on the same page**. Only the Scrum Team members, including ScrumMaster and Product Owner, speak during this meeting. Other interested parties can come and listen in.  Based on what comes up in the meeting, the Development Team reorganizes the work as needed to accomplish the Sprint Goal.

The Daily Scrum is a key element of Scrum, leading to **transparency**, **trust**, and **better performance**. It provides rapid recognition of problems, and promotes the team’s self-organization and self-reliance. All Scrum meetings are **time-boxed**. The recommended time-box for the Daily Scrum is no more than fifteen minutes. (*All of this paragraph comes from* [AgileAtlas](http://agileatlas.org/atlas/scrum#daily-scrum "Agile Atlas - Scrum"))

There is also a [huge post](http://martinfowler.com/articles/itsNotJustStandingUp.html "It's Not Just Standing Up: Patterns for Daily Standup Meetings") by **Martin Fowler** on what is what isn’t a daily stand up meeting. It covers a lot of aspects on this topic and if you have not already read it, you should read it asap.
 
##How

###When
We meet at 9:30 when everybody is usually arrived. Our team is mostly colocated and at 9:30 everyone is usually already at his desk. I use the app [Lightning Talk](http://lightningtalktimer.com/ "Lightning Talk Timer - Presentation Timer for iPad and iPhone") so that everyone can see the his own time box (1 minute per person) and keep the focus on what he has to say.

###Where
We meet in our open space where we have enough space for standing up all together.

###Who
Daily standups are for team members only. It is a development team meeting. Everyone who wants to join is welcomed as long as he can sit in silence and without disturbing others. As of now I hope the meeting will remain “*private*” for a little longer in order for team members to feel safe, free to speak and comfortable with the process

##Impediments and point of action
* We got some **interruptions**, so we decided to close the door of the open space during the daily standup and explain to who interrupts us (possibly after the standup) what we are doing. Our hope is to significantly reduce the number of interrupts.
* It seems nobody is having impediments. Uhm… this is suspicious.
	1. There are really no impediments. (uhm….)
	2. There are impediments but they are coming from outside the dev team. (could be)
	3. There are impediments coming from inside the dev team BUT they don’t want to look other team members in the eye telling them what is stopping them. (could be but I don’t believe it is the case)
	4. **There are impediments but they don’t feel them as their own**. “*I did my job so I am done. No impediments for me*“. (sub: I don’t care if the feature is done because my task is over, so it is not my problem). This is what I think is happening to some of us and it is not so easy to solve. We have a long path in front of us. We need to start thinking of “team success” or “team failure”. And thinking as a team is not the job of a week. But I am working on this. ;)

##How is it going
Apart from some interruptions that we hope to address, we are going well. The team is **focused**, everyone arrives **on time**, and apart from someone new to the standup they can manage to answer shortly to the three questions in the time-box they have. At the end of this short meeting the feeling is good, everyone is updated and on the same page, and we feel ready to start a new day!

As I said we need to change our mind and **start thinking of Team success or Team failure**. There should be no “*I completed my task so who cares*“. But to get there we have a lot of work to do. We have just started.
