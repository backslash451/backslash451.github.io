Yesterday was the last day of my Certfied Scrum Master training. Here are some thoughts on these two days.

##Amazing
These two days have been simply amazing. The course organized by Kleer and held by Martin Alaimo, which among other things i bought by myself, was at the same time shocking and inspiring. We were ten people attending the course and Martin did a great job preparing materials, workshops and theory lessons. We were divided into two groups of five people each and we learnt how to manage and work as a team, a Scrum team, during these two days.

The 1000€ i spent to buy the CSM course has been the best money i have ever spent for training/education. The overall feeling i personally got after the training was like having my head opened in two and filled with visions of a better world. Something like “Inception”, you know.

These two days have been simply amazing. The course organized by [Kleer](http://www.kleer.la/ "Kleer - Agile Coaching & Training") and held by [Martin Alaimo](http://www.martinalaimo.com/ "Martín Alaimo - Agile Coach & Trainer"), which among other things i bought by myself, was **at the same time shocking and inspiring**.

##Theory

Martin began the course giving us historical background of Agile Methodologies in order to understand why we get here. Why traditional methodologies cannot work efficiently in a complex environment where you cannot predict in advance the consequences of your actions. He explained how we are now living in a world of “knowledge workers” and why the theorems of Ford, Taylor and Fayol cannot be applied to us. We are not building cars, we should build software!


He explained the concept of R=R. Results of a Team are equal (or at least directly proportional) to the Relationships the team members are able to build. That is a simple but brilliant concept.

We then moved to the Scrum framework, because Scrum is a not a methodology, is a framework. In a methodology you have a defined path to follow to find a solution to your problem. Scrum is a tool to help you (and your team) to find the “emergent practices” that best fit your needs.

He explained some concepts of XP as well, such as User Stories, some concepts of Lean Startup such as the MVP (or walking skeleton) and we then moved to the Pareto law and its implications.

##Workshops

Martin prepared even some workshops and exercises in order to simulate typical situations and common issues that may arise during the Scrum phases. One of these was really inspiring.

We were told to walk in an empty room towards a point and then move straight from there to another point. At some point, after some walking Martin asked to choose two partners without letting them know and trying to move in the room in order to form a triangle with them keeping the same distance from both.

At the beginning it was a total mess. Everyone was moving and no one ever stopped so no triangles formed. No one thought that we would never have achieved  the goal but then, after some seconds, people started to slow down till the moment every one was standing still and all the triangles were formed correctly!

The exercise was made to prove that a team can self-organize itself to reach a goal and probably it will perform better than trying to reach the same goal with someone else thinking about the best way to do it, communicating the solution designed to the team, and executing it.

##Conclusions

As you have already understood i am super happy with this course and i recommend it to everyone interested in learning agile methodologies and Scrum. The price could seems a bit high if you have to pay for it without the help of your company, but i can assure you it is totally worth the price.
