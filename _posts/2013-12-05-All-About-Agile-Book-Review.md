I recently bought [“All about Agile” – Agile management made easy!](http://amazon.com/dp/1469915510 "All About Agile: Agile Management Made Easy!: Kelly Waters: 9781469915517: Amazon.com: Books") by [Kelly Waters](https://twitter.com/kelly_waters). This book is an organized and revised collection of the posts of the [blog of K. Waters](http://www.allaboutagile.com/ "All About Agile - Agile Development Made Easy!").

The book is well organized and if you prefer you can just jump to the “post” you want do deepen. There is obviously a main theme in the book if you prefer reading it from page 1 to 370, but i think that the possibility to jump here and there is very useful.

The approach of Waters towards readers is and educational one. He try to guide you trough Agile and Scrum, starting from the Why, moving to the What and to the How. One of the most popular posts series on the blog became the chapter “**How to implement Scrum in 10 easy steps**“. Very very useful. Short, straight to the point and very clear.


Among User stories, Agile estimating an Agile testing chapters there are other useful chapters like Agile project management, Agile teams and Agile leadership. Those chapters are a great deepening on three questions:

1. Is the need for projects (and traditional managers) dead?
2. How can I build an Agile team?
3. How can I introduce Agile in my company?

There is also a interesting digression on Lean and it principles together with an small chapter on Kanban.

In the end “All about Agile” is a good book, maybe too soft on the Scrum process itself (but there is plenty of info on that on Internet), but very useful when it comes to real life situations and handling common problems.
