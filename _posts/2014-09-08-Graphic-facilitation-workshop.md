Some days ago i attented a workshop on **Graphic Facilitation** with [Kleer](http://www.kleer.la) and [Pablo Tortorella](https://twitter.com/pablitux). Here some thoughts on it.

##Drawing is for kids
Yeah, drawings is for kids. And it is so because kids really know how to enjoy their time! We started the workshop with a brief exercise trying to draw our greatest fear. We had paper, a pencil and a lot of colors. And we tried to draw something to represent what we had in mind thinking of our greatest fear. 

The workshop continued with Pablo explaining, with other excercises, the fundamental elements of the graphic facilitation, their meanings, the key roles in this *discipline* and a lot of practice for us. We started learning the graphic facilitation through iterations, firstly trying on our own, then looking at the result, then comparing with others and then improving our sketches.

##Key elements
One of the most usefull thing i learnt in the workshop is that once you have your own set of key elements in your toolbox, graphic facilitation became just a matter of combining them together. You just need to practice a lot on this set of key elements in order to be able to draw them very well and very fast while explaining everything to your audience. Here it is a list of the key elements you should have in your toolbox.

* Lines and figures
* Persons
* Symbols
* Text
* Boxes
* Bullets
* Colors & White
* Places
* Arrows
* Effects

Your toolbox may have some elements related to a specific context. If for example, you are working in IT, the most common and used symbol is the one representing the database. Or the one representing the server. And so on...

##Conclusions
Graphic facilitation is a tool you can use to explain something to people so that it will remain in their memory. You can use it to take notes when you are listening to someone. You can use it to plan you next trip, and everything else that comes to mind. It is a great tool, it is visual, fast, nice and it helps to focus.
